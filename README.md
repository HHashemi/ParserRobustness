## An Evaluation of Parser Robustness for Ungrammatical Sentences

This package includes the code used in our [EMNLP 2016 paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D16/D16-1182.pdf). 
The goal of this project is to find robustness of dependency parsers.
In order to achieve this goal, we developed an evaluation metric: Robustness F-score.


#### Src 
This directory contains the code to evaluate Robustness of a parser by comparing parse trees of Good and Bad sentences.


#### Data
This directory includes sample data for two domains of ESL and MT.
